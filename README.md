## Overview

This project was done within my Bachelor-Thesis with the title 'Evaluation of Text-to-Speech Engines'. 

It enables the user to type in a random text and compare the speech resuluts generated by clients from [Amazon Polly](app/src/main/java/at/fhooe/mc/pro3/texttospeech/PollyTTSClient.kt), [Google Cloud TTS](app/src/main/java/at/fhooe/mc/pro3/texttospeech/GoogleCloudTTSClient.kt), [Microsoft Azure TTS](app/src/main/java/at/fhooe/mc/pro3/texttospeech/AzureTTSClient.kt) and an internal engine (android.speech.tts package) with just a single click.

The requests are done asynchronlously with the help of Kotlin coroutines.

In order to work properly, a cloud account for each service with the corresponding settings has to be created.
