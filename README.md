This project was done within my Bachelor-Thesis with the title 'Evaluation of Text-to-Speech Engines'.

It enables the user to type in a random text and compare the speech resuluts generated by Amazon Polly, Google Cloud TTS and Mircosoft Azure TTS with just a single click.

In order to work properly, a cloud account for each service with the corresponding settings has to be created.
